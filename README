Conway's game of life

For a description of the game see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

This file will randomly seed the middle of the map at the beginning of the game. 
I've been trying out different seeding schemes (density, placement, etc) that tend to produce
more interesting results. 

- No gems, plugins, etc needed. Should just show in your terminal/console.
- Default is 80 x 40 map with 50 cycles. Or give it 3 arguments for columns, rows and cycles.
